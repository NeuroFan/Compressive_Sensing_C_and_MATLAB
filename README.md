Three well-known Sparse Recovery Algorithms implemented in C/C++ and MATLAB:


      I. Orthogonal Matching Pursuit ( OMP ),
      II. Iterative Hard Thresholding ( IHT ),  
      III. Approximage Message Passing ( AMP )  
Notice AMP needs intitial coefficients that were taken from Baranuik's work (detail in the code). Further the C code contains all subroutins that includes: QR decompostion, Gausian elimination, bubble-sort, back-substitution, etc.

# Introduction 
Excerpts are from our paper [1].

	  OMP is a greedy algorithm introduced as an extension to the well-established 
	  Matching Pursuit algorithm. The OMP algorithm iteratively finds the best matrix
	  columns that correspond to the non-zero coefficients of the sparse  signal, and then
	  performs a least squares (LS) optimization in the subspace formed from current and 
	  previously selected columns. AMP and the IHT algorithms do not require LS in each 
	  iteration, and instead perform simple vector truncation, which results in an 
	  iterative completion of the sparse signal. The parameters, such as step  size and 
	  threshold, are critical in the performance of AMP and IHT algorithms. The optimum
	  parameters of AMP are chosen based on the experimental results of . In the case of
	  the IHT algorithm, a different flavor of algorithm called Normalized-IHT was 
	  implemented, where the step size is automatically determined in each iteration.
      

# Results

	  For fair comparison of the algorithms, one must take into consideration the window
	  length of the signal, the sparsity degree of the test signal, the hyperparameters
	  of the algorithms, such as termination criteria and desired reconstruction quality.
	  From Fig. 4 [following figure], we observed that the OMP algorithm is fastest in
	  reconstruction, whereas the AMP and IHT algorithms that are known to be computationally
	  cheaper, appear to be slower.

      This is due to the low sparsity degree and short signal length. The OMP algorithm gives
      better performance for less sparse signals [27], and here the experiments were done
      with signals with less than 10% occupancy. The IHT algorithm’s performance is relatively
      independent from the sparsity degree, and the performance of   AMP is less sensitive to
      sparsity degree than the  OMP,. These issues are rather strong practical arguments for
      flexible designs.
